#Week One Assignment
##Modify Picture Class  

For this assignment, open up the Picture class and make the following changes:  

* Add a person object to the picture. Place the person object in an appropriate location.
* Add a void method called sunSet().  
* Add code to the sunSet() method such that when called, it will cause the sun in the object to set.

Hint:  Is there an existing method you can use to "set" the sun?

When you have finished, test your code by creating a new Picture object on the workbench and calling the sunSet method.

To submit this assignment, create a pull request on the original repository.

*Challange Exercises:*  
If your looking for some extra work, try these two challanges:  
1.  Color the Sunset.  As the sun sets, darken the color of the sun.  
2. Tatooine Sunset.  Two suns in the sky, set at the same time.
